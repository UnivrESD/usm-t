# === Verifing FIFO ===
# - reset test
# - verify write followed by read
#                   60 Reading data
# ERROR! => Result does not match! Got:   z (zz) expected: 170 (aa)
# - fill FIFO up
# - FIFO is full, another write should not have an affect
# - verify reading the data from the full FIFO back
#                  300 Reading data
#                  340 Reading data
#                  380 Reading data
#                  420 Reading data
# ERROR! => Result does not match! Got:   z (zz) expected: 115 (73)
# = Now test a read/write at the same clock =
# - First have an empty FIFO and do the read/write
#                  460 Reading data
#                  500 Reading data
# ERROR! => Result does not match! Got:   z (zz) expected: 128 (80)
# - Now have one entry in the FIFO and do a read/write
#                  580 Reading data
#                  620 Reading data
# ERROR! => Result does not match! Got:   z (zz) expected: 160 (a0)
# - Finally fill up the FIFO and to the read/write
#                  820 Reading data
#                  860 Reading data
#                  900 Reading data
#                  940 Reading data
#                  980 Reading data
# ERROR! => Result does not match! Got:   z (zz) expected:  33 (21)
# FIFO verification done!
